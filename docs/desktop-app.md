# Desktop app

I finish this projects collection with the desktop app. I develop and build it with [Electronjs](https://www.electronjs.org/) and [Hyperapp](https://hyperapp.dev/)

I also create a (Youtube video)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9tRyfSngkA] and a blog post if you want to learn more how I build this. (Check it out)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9tRyfSngkA] and subscribe [my channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXykqt3V2-9bYXKWZRcH0rA) if you like my tutorial.
